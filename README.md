  ## Description: 
  "Let me jot this down!" is an application that utilizes Node.js and Express, to create a responsive note-taking tool for users. Users can save their notes to the application, as well as delete and create new notes. This project utilizes directory paths, and post and get methods. One of the challenges I faces in completing this challenge assignment is keeping track of which directory references should use "./" vs "../" in order to have my paths function. I built this program to build my skills with using Insomnia, as well as the heroku CLI. 

  ## Installation: 
  To install this project, users must open the heroku application from my github(@musaliyah). In order to see all of the stored data beyond the deployed application, user's can download the file and observe the db.json file in the db directory.

  ## Usage: 
  To use "Let me jot this down!" users can type a note title and additional information in the given space to the right-side of the application. Users can then save the note by selecting the save icon in the upper right-hand corner of the application. If the user chooses to delete their not, they can press the trashcan icon next to their saved notes. Users can create new notes by pressing the plus symbol (+) also located in the upper right hand corner of the application.
